# reference-ray-tracer-optix
Real-time diffuse GPU path tracer in OptiX, based on [Ingo Wald's great course on OptiX](https://github.com/ingowald/optix7course), as a reference implementation to compare against the performance of the [algorithm developed for my Master's thesis](https://github.com/Jentuuh/scalable-coherent-path-tracing).
